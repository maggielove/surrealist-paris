	Here lie Romanian artist Victor Brauner (1903-1966, above left) and Surrealist writers Philippe Soupault (1897-1990, above right)
		and Jacques Rigaut. The two heads on top of Brauner’s tomb were carved by the artist himself, while the
		verses are by Surrealist writer Paul Eluard.
	<br>
	<br>
	Soupault was the last living Surrealist. Though he helped found the Surrealist movement,
		Soupault was ostracized from the group in 1926, having embraced the novel&mdash;which, due to its realistic nature (at the time)
		was rejected by Surrealist leader Breton&mdash;
		and an interest in journalism. It is somewhat ironic to include his grave on this virtual map, as Soupault wrote in <em>Story of a White Man</em>,
		“Neither flowers, nor crown, nor cross, nor statue. I believe neither in God nor in glory,” as is evident in the minimalism of his grave.
		Nonetheless, death played a significant role in the life of Soupault, who was deeply affected by the death of his father when
		he was seven, and was plagued by thoughts of suicide.
